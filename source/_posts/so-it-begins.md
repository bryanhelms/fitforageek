A group of coworkers decided to do a challenge to write about our workout and fitness efforts in an attempt to help keep each other honest. I briefly attempted a fitness blog years ago, but the blog (and the workouts) unfortunately didn't stick. As I've been much more consistent and successful with my workouts over the past few years, I'm hoping for similar results with my writing here.

Most of these posts will probably be short recaps of activity, just to have a consolidated record of what I'm doing. I expect I'll have longer posts from time to time as well, especially as I get a better feel for all this. As to my focus, mainly it's distance running with a little bit of weightlifting thrown in.

Disclosure time: I make no claim to be an expert in any of the things I will discuss here, and nobody should treat me as such. Please consult your own trainers/specialists/physicians for any kind of strenuous activity or regarding any issues you encounter when doing so.

Here's to sharing our journeys with each other!
