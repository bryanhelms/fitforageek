I was very nervous about today's run. My half marathon training plan called for a 1:45-2:00 long run, which was very initimidating as it would be the longest I had run since my last half marathon last August. And since I still sorely needed hill training, I chose to run across and back on the Golden Gate Bridge as well. It would be a great practice run for the SF First Half since it was basically the course that race takes.

For a little background, I was not prepared for this race and this course last year. I had to walk the hills, started having foot and hip pain around mile 6, began cramping somewhere between miles 8 and 9, and my calves started spasming around mile 10. Finishing that race was hell. I've been a little afraid of hill running ever since then. (I should probably write a post about that one day too.)

I'm happy to report that I was much more successful today! I ran all the hills, the major ones being the hill at Fort Mason and the climb from Crissy Field to the Golden Gate Bridge. And I didn't feel like I was going to die, either! I'm super pleased with my results today and for the first time feel like I'm fully ready for my upcoming race. 

I ran out of juice a little bit on the return run, but that's because I didn't eat properly before the run and my tank hit empty. After walking/resting for a bit, I managed to start running again after an energy gel and finished the last 20 minutes or so at a similar pace to what I had been running before. Not to mention I got this _gorgeous_ view when I was on the bridge:

Here are the details of the run, split because of the break I took:
